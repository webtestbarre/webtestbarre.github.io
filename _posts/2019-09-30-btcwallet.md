Time to get that pen and paper. Once you are ready tap Got it. Write down the backup phrase with that pen and paper.

Do not write your backup phrase in your computer or in a text document or in your phone.

I repeat use that pen and paper and store that paper in a proper safe location. Anyone getting that backup phrase can spend your bitcoins.

Tap Receive.

The pixeled "thing" in the middle is called a QR Code.

The big chain of characters is your address.

If you want to receive bitcoin, all you need to do is either: 

-show/send the QR Code.

-send the address(the 2nd red arrow, you can copy it by tapping).

-send both for confirmation.

The bitcoin.com wallet have a QR Code reader.

This will allow you to scan a QR Code to send your bitcoin.
