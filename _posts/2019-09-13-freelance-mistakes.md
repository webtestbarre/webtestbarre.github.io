1st mistake

![schoolLearning](https://www.fredbarre.com/img/school.jpg)

I learned programming at school but it gave me bad habits.When you are learning for paper exams, you are trying to memorise as much as possible because you are not allowed to use google during the exam...
And you will often start work from the scratch.In real situations you can copy and paste your past work to save a lot of time. You need to learn to use the tools at your disposal to do the work like google or word.Even if you are not stuck its better to do a google search to have a huge speed boost.

2nd mistake

![client](https://www.fredbarre.com/img/empty.png)

My 1st client wasn't ready to put the price, and it put the burden on me to make it work.And tried to work fast.I did it anyway for 1 euro per hour for two months.
It was a valuable learning experience but that might have been too much.

3rd mistake

I felt I wasn't good enough... That I had to compensate with more of my time and effort.
So I did something close to 18 to 20 hours per day of work.
No matter what, I think 10 hours a day is most I can offer(even if I am bad at the job).

4th mistake

During a freelance mission I still need to do things I normally do like going to sport one to two times a week, take some fresh air outside.
This will allow me to not burnout again and still take some pleasure in my work.

5th mistake

Make it clear your ability to yourself and your client if you can succeed the mission.

The extra tip is to use software or websites that boost your speed and/or the quality of work. Since it was a programming freelance mission mine was about the ability to go back to what worked at a previous save.

Summary:

1st mistake I was in "learning mode/exam mode" instead of being in "doing the best/fastest job" I can using any resource I have including google.

2nd mistake price (€1/h)

3rd Time Management(20h-18h/day work)

4th Energy Management(burnout)

5th know the Limits on your ability(promised way too much for that)/ time wise.

extra tip: Use Github/Git or other Version Control software.
